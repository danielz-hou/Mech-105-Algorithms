# Root Finding
The False Position MATLAB function inputs the function being evaluated, the lower guess, the upper guess, the desired relative error, the maximum number of iterations to use, and any additional parameters used by the function and outputs the estimated root location, the function evaluated at the root location, the approximate relative error, and how many iterations were performed.

The Root Finding MATLAB script solves for the angle (θ) required to pull a block attached to a rope that is at an angle (θ) from horizontal and has a fixed tension force of 150N using bisection.
